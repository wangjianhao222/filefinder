# filefinder
The File Finder App is a Python-based desktop application built with Tkinter. It allows you to search files on your computer with advanced filtering options.
Key features include:

Search by filename pattern (supports partial/fuzzy matching).

Choose a search path or scan all drives.

Filter by file extension (e.g., .txt, .pdf).

Filter by minimum and maximum file size (in MB).

Sort results by name, path, or size.

View real-time search progress.

Uses a cache system to speed up repeated searches.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
